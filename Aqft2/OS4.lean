This module implements the OS4 (Ergodicity) axiom for the Osterwalder-Schrader
reconstruction theorem. The content was originally developed in OS4draft.lean
and integrated into the main codebase on August 17, 2025.

The OS4 axiom ensures that spacetime translations act ergodically on field
configurations, which is crucial for reconstructing vacuum correlations in QFT.

/-! #### Flow Structure
    A flow represents a measure-preserving dynamical system on a measurable space.
    In the context of QFT, flows typically represent spacetime translations of field configurations.
-/

/--
A flow is a group action of ℝ on a measurable space Ω, satisfying:
1. Measurability of the joint action
2. Identity element acts as the identity map
3. Group composition property

In QFT, flows represent spacetime translations of field configurations.

  /-- At time 0, the flow is the identity transformation.

  /-- Group property: Flowing for time s+t equals flowing for time t then for time s.

Each time-slice of the flow is measurable. We need this applying
Fubini's theorem and for establishing measurability of time averages.

This follows from the joint measurability of the flow and the fact that
the constant function t and the identity function are measurable.

Time-average (Cesàro) along the flow over window length `R`.
This represents the average value of a function f along the orbit of ω
for time parameter ranging from 0 to R.

In ergodic theory, this average converges (as R→∞) to the space average
for almost all starting points ω.

For R = 0, we define the average to be 0 by convention.

Helper lemma for measurable_timeAverage: Proves measurability of parametric integrals involving flows.
This lemma establishes that for a measurable function f and a flow φ,
the function ω ↦ ∫ f(φ.T s ω) ds over [0,R] is measurable.

This is a critical step in proving that time averages are measurable functions.
The key insight is to recognize that (s,ω) ↦ f(φ.T s ω) is jointly measurable
when f is measurable and φ is a flow, which allows us to apply our general
parametric integration result.

Ergodicity via invariant sets: only trivial invariant sets.

A flow is ergodic if every invariant set has either measure zero or full measure.
This is the standard definition of ergodicity in measure theory, and is
equivalent to other formulations via time averages or mixing properties.

In physical terms, ergodicity means that the system cannot be decomposed into
separate invariant subsystems - it is irreducible.

  Key insight: In an ergodic system, every invariant set has either measure zero
  or full measure. This implies invariant functions must be constant.

  Proof approach:
  1. Assume f is invariant but not essentially constant
  2. Show there must exist a level set A = {x | f(x) ≤ a} with measure strictly
     between 0 and μ(univ)
  3. Show this level set is invariant
  4. This contradicts ergodicity

  Since we've reached a contradiction, our initial assumption must be false.
  Therefore, f must be essentially constant.

A clean OS4 axiom: invariant measure, ergodicity by sets, and time-average equals ensemble-average a.e.

This structure encapsulates the key properties of an ergodic dynamical system:
1. A probability measure on the state space
2. A flow (group action) on the state space
3. The measure is preserved by the flow
4. The flow is ergodic (only trivial invariant sets)
5. Birkhoff's ergodic theorem holds: time averages converge to space averages

In the context of QFT, this axiom ensures that spacetime translations act ergodically
on the field configurations, which is crucial for reconstructing vacuum correlations.

QFT-flavored packaging of the OS4 axiom, using a probability measure on field space.

This presents the same mathematical content as OS4Axiom but with notation more

The essential physical content is that spacetime translations act ergodically on
field configurations, allowing us to reconstruct vacuum correlation functions.

A flow is a group action of ℝ on a measurable space Ω, satisfying:

2. Identity element acts as the identity map
3. Group composition property

In QFT, flows represent spacetime translations of field configurations.

Each time-slice of the flow is measurable. We need this applying

Time-average (Cesàro) along the flow over window length `R`.
This represents the average value of a function f along the orbit of ω

for almost all starting points ω.

For R = 0, we define the average to be 0 by convention.

Helper lemma for measurable_timeAverage: Proves measurability of parametric integrals involving flows.
This lemma establishes that for a measurable function f and a flow φ,
the function ω ↦ ∫ f(φ.T s ω) ds over [0,R] is measurable.

This is a critical step in proving that time averages are measurable functions.
The key insight is to recognize that (s,ω) ↦ f(φ.T s ω) is jointly measurable
when f is measurable and φ is a flow, which allows us to apply our general
parametric integration result.

Ergodicity via invariant sets: only trivial invariant sets.

A flow is ergodic if every invariant set has either measure zero or full measure.
This is the standard definition of ergodicity in measure theory, and is
equivalent to other formulations via time averages or mixing properties.

In physical terms, ergodicity means that the system cannot be decomposed into
separate invariant subsystems - it is irreducible.

  Key insight: In an ergodic system, every invariant set has either measure zero
  or full measure. This implies invariant functions must be constant.

  Proof approach:
  1. Assume f is invariant but not essentially constant
  2. Show there must exist a level set A = {x | f(x) ≤ a} with measure strictly
     between 0 and μ(univ)
  3. Show this level set is invariant
  4. This contradicts ergodicity

  Since we've reached a contradiction, our initial assumption must be false.

Birkhoff's Ergodic Theorem characterization: time averages converge to space averages.
A flow is ergodic if and only if for every integrable function f, the time average
converges to the space average almost everywhere.

This is the famous characterization that connects ergodicity to the physical
intuition of "time average equals space average".

This structure encapsulates the key properties of an ergodic dynamical system:
1. A probability measure on the state space
2. A flow (group action) on the state space
3. The measure is preserved by the flow
4. The flow is ergodic (only trivial invariant sets)
5. Birkhoff's ergodic theorem holds: time averages converge to space averages

In the context of QFT, this  ensures that spacetime translations act ergodically
on the field configurations, which is crucial for reconstructing vacuum correlations.
